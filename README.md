Hi there! I’m Thalyssa, a computer scientist based in Brazil, focused on back-end development. I’m looking for junior opportunities in API and back-end development, with a strong interest in data analysis and visual novel development.

I primarily work with Python (Django) and Java.

Some projects I’ve worked on include…

- [Web crawler - ALESC](https://github.com/thalyssa/crawler-alesc/tree/master) - Dockerized web crawler to fetch, process and store event data from the website of the Legislative Assembly of the State of Santa Catarina, ensuring reproducible and isolated execution environments (Python – BeautifulSoup, Docker)

- [Budget Tracking](https://github.com/thalyssa/ControleFinaceiroDjango) - Budget tracking web application designed and developed with Django for an introductory web development course I taught, serving as a reference implementation for beginners and emphasizing CRUD architecture (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

- [PocketAnalysisLab](https://github.com/thalyssa/PocketAnalysisLab) - Content analysis web service built in Python, integrating the ChatGPT API to process and analyze text data, with cloud deployment and public access via Streamlit Cloud (final course project).
